## Option 1: Short & Impactful

---

🚀 **Just built an end-to-end Credit Risk ML Pipeline on Databricks!**

After weeks of work, I'm excited to share my latest project - a production-grade credit risk assessment system aligned with Swiss banking standards.

**What I built:**
📊 Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
🤖 4 ML models including XGBoost (AUC: 0.78)
🔍 SHAP explainability for regulatory compliance
⚡ Automated CI/CD pipeline

**Tech Stack:**
• Databricks Lakehouse
• Delta Lake
• XGBoost & scikit-learn
• SHAP Values
• GitHub Actions

**Why it matters:**
Swiss regulators (FINMA) require model interpretability - banks must explain WHY a loan was denied. This project demonstrates how to build compliant ML systems.

## Option 2: Technical Deep-Dive

🏦 **Building Credit Risk Models the Swiss Banking Way**

Just completed a comprehensive ML pipeline that demonstrates techniques used at UBS, Credit Suisse, and Julius Baer.

**The Challenge:**
Predict credit card defaults while meeting strict regulatory requirements for model explainability.

**The Solution:**

1️⃣ **Data Pipeline (Medallion Architecture)**
- Bronze: Raw data ingestion (30K records)
- Silver: Data cleaning, categorical encoding
- Gold: 37 engineered features

2️⃣ **Machine Learning**
- Baseline: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Advanced: XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
- Result: 82% accuracy, 0.78 AUC

3️⃣ **Swiss Compliance (FINMA)**
- SHAP values for individual prediction explanations
- Cross-validation for robust model validation
- Complete audit trail

**Sample Output:**
```
Customer Risk Explanation:
Prediction: DEFAULT (73.5% probability)
Top factors:
  - Recent payment delay (+23%)
  - High credit utilization (+16%)
  - Multiple delayed months (+10%)
```

This is exactly what regulators want to see - transparent, explainable AI.

## Option 3: Career-Focused

---

📈 **From Learning to Building: My Data Engineering Portfolio Project**

I've been preparing for Data/ML Engineer roles in Swiss finance, and I wanted to share what I've learned by building something real.

**Project: Credit Risk ML Pipeline**

Instead of just following tutorials, I built a production-style system that demonstrates:

✅ **Data Engineering**
- Medallion Architecture with Delta Lake
- Automated data quality checks
- Feature engineering (37 features)

✅ **Machine Learning**
- 4 models trained and compared
- XGBoost (industry standard in banking)
- 82% accuracy on 30K customer records

✅ **Swiss Banking Focus**
- SHAP explainability (required by FINMA)
- Cross-validation for Basel III compliance
- Individual prediction explanations

✅ **Production Practices**
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Databricks Workflows
- Clean, documented code

**Key Learning:**
Building > Reading. This project taught me more than months of courses.

Looking for opportunities in Data Engineering / ML Engineering in Switzerland 🇨🇭
